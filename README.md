# Find Hackers with Anomaly Detection and Gradio 

Spotting weird things happening is extremely useful when it comes to analytics. One application of this is anomaly detection! In this project, you'll learn how to use anomaly detection to find weird patterns in web traffic data.

## Anomaly Detection in Web Traffic

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in web traffic across different regions. It's designed to assist IT departments in identifying unusual spikes in data, which could be indicative of security concerns or other issues.

## Overview

Anomaly detection is a crucial technique in data analytics, especially for identifying unusual patterns that deviate from the norm. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to detect anomalies in web traffic data, helping organizations identify potential security threats or performance issues.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Conduct a thorough analysis of web traffic data to identify patterns and potential anomalies.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize various anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor.
- **Gradio Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface using Gradio for easy interaction with the anomaly detection model.

## Why Anomaly Detection Matters

Anomalies in web traffic data could indicate a variety of issues, including security breaches, server errors, or unusual user behavior. By accurately detecting these anomalies, organizations can take proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure the smooth operation of their web services.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-time anomaly detection capabilities to monitor web traffic continuously.
- Integrate additional data sources, such as server logs and network traffic, for more comprehensive anomaly detection.
- Enhance the user interface with advanced visualization tools for better insights into detected anomalies.
